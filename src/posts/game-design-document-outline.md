# Creating a Game Design Document

A game design document is the blueprint from which a game is built. As such, every single detail necessary to build the game should be addressed.  The larger the team and the longer the design and development cycle, the more critical this document becomes. For our purpose, the intent is to capture as much as possible of the design and be clear about what the software delivers and what the design entails.  Our recommendation is that you define the ultimate game and then clarify what it is that you have developed.

## Game Design Document Outline

1.	Title Page   
    1.1.	Game Name – Perhaps also add a subtitle or high concept sentence.
2.	Game Overview    
    2.1.	Game Concept    
    2.2.	Genre    
    2.3.	Target Audience    
    2.4.	Game Flow Summary – How does the player move through the game in terms of the interface and the game itself.    
    2.5.	Look and Feel – What is the basic look and feel of the game?  What is the visual style?    
3.	Gameplay and  Mechanics    
    3.1.	Gameplay    
        3.1.1.	Game Progression        
        3.1.2.	Mission/challenge Structure        
        3.1.3.	Puzzle Structure        
        3.1.4.	Objectives – What are the objectives of the game?    
        3.1.5.	Play Flow – How does the game flow for the game player    
    3.2.	Mechanics – What are the rules to the game, both implicit and explicit.  This is the model of the universe that the game works under.  Think of it as a simulation of a world, how do all the pieces interact?  This actually can be a very large section.    
        3.2.1.	Physics – How does the physical universe work?    
        3.2.2.	Movement in the game    
        3.2.3.	Objects – how to pick them up and move them     
        3.2.4.	Actions, including whatever switches and buttons are used, interacting with objects, and what means of communication are used    
        3.2.5.	Combat – If there is combat or even conflict, how is this specifically modeled?    
        3.2.6.	Economy – What is the economy of the game? How does it work?    
        3.2.7.	Screen Flow -- A graphical description of how each screen is related to every other and a description of the purpose of each screen.    
    3.3.	Game Options – What are the options and how do they affect game play and mechanics?    
    3.4.	Replaying and Saving     
    3.5.	Cheats and Easter Eggs    
4.	Story, Setting and Character

    4.3.	Characters.  Each character should include the back story, personality, appearance, animations, abilities, relevance to the story and relationship to other characters     
5.	Levels    
    5.1.	Levels.  Each level should include a synopsis, the required introductory material (and how it is provided), the objectives, and the details of what happens in the level.  Depending on the game, this may include the physical description of the map, the critical path that the player needs to take, and what encounters are important or incidental.    
    5.2.	Training Level    
6.	Interface    
    6.1.	Visual System.  If you have a HUD, what is on it?  What menus are you displaying? What is the camera model?
